# git-pocket
Save and sync uncommitted changes in a working directory. Like `git stash`, but allows you to share stashed changes across drives and computers. Great for developers constantly on the move or switching between different machines. Works great with USB drives or a syncing service, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

## Installation
You must have [Fish shell](http://fishshell.com) installed to run the script, because I was too lazy to write it in Bash.

Simply download the `git-pocket` file or clone this repo and put `git-pocket` somewhere in your PATH. Then it should be ready to run via `git pocket`.

## Usage
You can invoke this Git plugin as `git-pocket` or as `git pocket`. See `git-pocket --help` for usage details.
